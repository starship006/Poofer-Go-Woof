This was starship006's submission for the Battlecode 2022 scaffold! While the robot may look very simplistic... well, it kinda is. It wasn't the most complex, as I developed this robot as a quick one-week sprint to try to put out any robot (I was too busy for this competition but I wanted to do _something_)

I was very much pleasantly surprised at how it perfromed - it ended up at exactly the 50th percentile of all competitors at the end of the competition, _even though I stopped with a couple weeks left to go!_

The robot taught me the absolute importance of organized code. It was spaghetti code at its finest, and the slight change to one thing would probably break all my robots. Expanding this robot would barely be feasable and would probably require a significant amount of refactoring of the original code.

But hey, for my first attempt at a competition, it was enthralling! Totally gonna do it again next year, with a bit more focus on producing a good robot :)
